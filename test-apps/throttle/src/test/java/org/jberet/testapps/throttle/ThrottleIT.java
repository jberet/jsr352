/**
 * The test job has a chunk-step with 10 partitions. When the test client starts many jobs one after another,
 * all available threads in the pool may be quickly used up, and by the time some job execution needs to allocate
 * threads to partitions, there is no more threads available, hence the deadlock.
 * <p/>
 * The purpose of the tests is to verify that the batch runtime should be able to detect the potential deadlock risk
 * when starting a new job executions, and queue it up for later execution when threads are available, to avoid deadlock.
 * <p/>
 * The batch runtime is configured to have a fixed thread pool of size 10, in src/main/resources/jberet.properties
