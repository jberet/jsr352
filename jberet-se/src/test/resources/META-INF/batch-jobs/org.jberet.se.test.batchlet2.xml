     The initial job start will complete stepA, stepB, stepC, stepD, and stop at stepE.

     The restart will begin with stepB, as specified in stepE's stop element.  So stepA should not appear in restart,
     even though stepA allows start if complete.

     stepB does not allow start if complete, so restart will skip stepB.

     stepC allows start if complete, so the first step during restart is stepC.

     stepD is skipped during restart since it does not allow start if complete.

     The original JobExecution STOPPED at stepE, but stepE itself COMPLETED. Since stepE allow-start-if-complete is true,
     so stepE is re-run during restart.

     So the restart JobExecution contains 2 StepExecutions (stepC & stepE), and the restart JobExecution COMPLETED.
